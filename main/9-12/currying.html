        //1. currying with help of bind method 
        let multiply = function(x, y)
        {
            console.log(x * y);
        }

        let multiplybytwo = multiply.bind(this, 2);
        //bind creates copy of multiply method 

        //2 will be set as x in multiply()

        multiplybytwo(5);
        //5 stores in y

        //2. currying with help of closure
