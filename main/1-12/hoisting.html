/*
Variable Declaration will be moved at the top (of its function).

- works only with var 
- happens in the background of variables 
- applicable for functions and classes

1. Variable Declaration 
2. Variable Defination 

```bash 
var a;              //declaration 
a = 10;             //defination 
var abcd = 10; 
console.log(abcd);
```

- if you have declared, not defined variable
```bash
var a;
console.log(a);
```

### Why is it undefined? why haven't it crashed, why no error? 
you should not have access to variable before its defined.

bad practice:
```bash
    console.log(a);   //undefined
    var a = 10; 
    console.log(a);   //10
```
since were writing var a after console.log, hosting happens here 
and it moves declaration to the top, that's why there is no error 
shown.

> However, if there was no **var a = 10**
> then hoisting will not happen and hence it will show error.

```bash
    console.log(a);   //error
```

since its a bad practice, let is not allowed for hoisting.
