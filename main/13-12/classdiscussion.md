1. questions regarding object and functions 
2. CSS -> CSSOM, css specificity 
3. Scope (scope chaining, lexical scope)
3.1 let vs var in a loop 

4. developer console

5. Create a timer app (using setInterval and setTimeout)
clearinterval vs cleartimeout 

6. difference between call and apply
- in apply you can pass args dyanamicaly, because we pass arguments in form on array 

7. DOM 
- global object has tree like structure
- used to change style, content, children, manipulation
- reference/ representation/ parsing of html string into an object 

8. BOM (Browser object model)
parent of DOM IS BOM 

> anything in DOM is part of BOM 

Under the hood, DOM is BOM's child
console.log(document);
console.log(window.document);
console.log(window.document == document); //true 

 //they are the same 

everything that happens in browser actually happens in bom 

DOM 
changes properties of html document 

BOM 
changes property of browser
