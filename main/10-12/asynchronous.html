    JS Engine:
    > single threaded engine
    it executes only one process at a given time, but it executes it so smartly, that we feel its happening parallely.
    
    it executes line by line, in a sequence, but under the hood, its sequential
    
    thread count: how many single process can it execute at the same time 

    JS is a single threaded language

    JS is synchronous.

    Synchronous 
    ✅ execute in a sequence 
    ✅ execute line by line 

    Asynchronous 
    not executed line by line 
    ✅ doesnt care about output 
    ✅ doesnt wait for previous function execution
  
    General programming is synchronous,
    there are situations where you would rather prefer asynchronous programming 

    should use:
    await with async 

    cannot use:
    async without await
