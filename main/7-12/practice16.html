    we have to remove the task from the tasks[] as well,
    until now we've only removed it from the viewport 

    We entered these in the input fields 
    1. task 1 
    2. task 2 

    we deleted task 2, by clicking on ❌
    this prints in the console:
    <li id="li_btn_1">
    "task 2"
    <button id="btn_1">X</button>
    </li>

    However, in the tasks[], its still not deleted 
    > console.log(tasks);

      2. we use split function to delete element from task list 

      3. we use splice to remove it from the array
