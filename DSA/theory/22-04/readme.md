1. We have an array find the index of the given element for 
- first occurance
- last occurence 
<!-- sorted array -->
```bash 
[2, 4, 10, 10, 10, 18, 20]
# user enters 10
# first occurance of 10 is at index 2
# last occurance of 10 is at index 4 
```
> ans:
```bash 
# trying through binary search 
lets assume first elem in array is start and last is end
then find mid 

if data[mid]> mid then elem will be on rhs on array 
if data[mid]< mid then elem will be on lhs on array 
when we find the mid element = data 

we also search on both lhs and rhs of the mid data we find 
we create a result variable where we'll increement index of the value were trying to search everytime we find data = mid[elem] 
```
> first occurance 
```bash 
# finding first occurance of 10 
let ele = 10 
let arr = [1, 2, 10, 10, 10]

let start = 0
let end = n-1
let res = -1 #in case we didnt find the element were searching for 
# res will be updated with the index of the elem were searching the occurance for 

while(start <= end){
    # first index + last index / 2
    let mid = start + Math.floor((start - end) / 2);

    if(ele = arr[mid]){
        # res contains the first occurance we found till now 
        res = mid
        # search for the element on the lhs of the array 
        end = mid - 1
    }
    else if(ele < arr[mid]){
        # then the data would be found on the lhs of the array 
        end = mid - 1
    }
    else {
        # when ele > arr[mid]
        # data found on rhs of array 
        start = mid + 1
    }
    return res
}

```
> last occurance 
```bash 
# finding last occurance of 10 
let ele = 10 
let arr = [1, 2, 10, 10, 10]

let start = 0
let end = n-1
let res = -1 #in case we didnt find the element were searching for 
# res will be updated with the index of the elem were searching the occurance for 

while(start <= end){
     let mid = start + Math.floor((start - end) / 2);

    if(ele = arr[mid]){
        # res contains the first occurance we found till now 
        res = mid
        # search for the element on the rhs of the array 
        start = mid + 1
    }
    else if(ele < arr[mid]){
        # then the data would be found on the lhs of the array 
        end = mid - 1
    }
    else {
        # when ele > arr[mid]
        # data found on rhs of array 
        start = mid + 1
    }
    return res
