### Data structure 
Data structure is the organization pf data in a way that can be used efficiently. 
- In order to use data efficiently we need to store data efficiently 

> an ideal DS is the one that takes the least possible time for all its soperation and consumes the least memory space 

efficency of DS is always measured in terms of time and space 

On what basis can we compare the time complexity of DS? On basis on operations performed on them.

#### Selecting best possible DS for a particular operation
> first approach: array - if we want to add data to the beginning of the list, we add element to the right index and we shift all the element
> second appproach: linked list - linking the node to be added to the beginning of the list. inserting an element at beginning of the list is faster in linked list.

### Asymptotic Notations: Big O, Big Omega, Big theta 
how to figure out the better algorithm?

> What is asymptotic notation?
asymptotic notation used to compare one algorithm with another.
