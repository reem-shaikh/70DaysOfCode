### Reverse a linked list 
> 1. Iterative method 
```bash
# if there are 4 nodes 

# head 
# |
# 1 => 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> null

# to reverse this, we'll reverse the pointer till 2nd node 
# 3rd node is stored in temp because when we break the links between 2 and 3 we'll loose 3rd node 

#           temp
#           |
# 1 <- 2    3 -> 4 -> null 


#now we assign the pointer from 3 to 2 and we shift the temp pointer to point at 4 
#               temp
#                |
# 1 <- 2  <- 3   4 -> null

#then we shift temp to null and assign pointer from 4 to 3 
#                      temp
#                        |
# 1 <- 2  <- 3  <- 4 -> null
```

> whats the difference between `undefined` and `null` in linked list context 
```bash
null has a datatype object 
undefined has no datatype 
#you need to ensure your pointers point at the right node, when your using undefined in place of null
#theres a slight difference in both their implementation and it has to do with pointers. 

#for example, prepend function using data which points to null, would look like this:
    prepend(data){
        const p = {
            value: data,
            next: null
        }
        #if p=4
        #linked list: 2 -> 10 

        #4->2
        p.next = this.head 
        #4->2
        #|
        #head 
        this.head = p 
    }

#prepend function using data which points to undefined, would look like this:
    prepend(data){
        const p = {
            value: data,
            next: undefined 
        }
        #4-> undefined -> 2

        p.next = this.head.next

        #undefined <- 4 -> 2

        #          head.next
        this.head.next = p

    #the reason: first node is pointing to undefined, it has no datatype so we need to point to the next node

Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

> Approaches: 
```bash
#JAVA 
#Approach 1: Brute Force -O(N) TC AND O(N)SC
Create a hash map, traverse over every node, and every node thats traversed will be added to the hashmap,  hash map will contain unique elements. However if its a linked list cycle then any node in the hashmap will repeat twice and when this happens we can return true 

#Approach 2: FLYOD'S LOOP DETECTION -O(N) TC AND O(1) SC
#take 2 pointers, slow pointer moves in one node interval, fast pointer moves at two node interval 
#if there is a cycle, there will come a point where slow pointer and fast pointer will collide ona  single node
#however, if there is no cycle, i.e its a linear linked list, then last pointer will point at null 
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
      #if linked list is empty then return false because it cannot be a cycle 
        if(head == null || head.next == null){
          return false;
        }
        #assign both pointers to head 
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;

        #if fast reaches null that means its not a cycle 
        #when fast is on the last node && fast is on the second last node 
        while(fast.next!=null && fast.next.next!=null){
          #move fast by 2 steps 
          fast = fast.next.next;
          #move slow by 1 step 
          slow = slow.next;
          #if fast and slow pointer meet at any point, then its a cycle 
          if(fast == slow){
            return true;
          }
        }

> Linked List cycle ii 
check whether linked list has cycle, then return posiiton/index of node where cycle stops

Do not modify the linked list.

> Merge Two sorted lists 
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

> Happy Number 
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.

Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
```bash
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

Input: n = 2
Output: false
#because 2^0 + 0^0 = 4 
```
> working 
```bash
Input: 123 
# extract digits 
# square them and add them up 

#we'll get all individual digits, by using % and / operators 
123 % 10 = 3     123/10= 12 
12 % 10 = 2      12/10 = 1 
1 % 10 = 1       1/10 = 0 

#we'll then square these numbers 
1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 

#14
1^2 + 4^2 = 17 

#17 
1^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 49 = 50

#50 
5^0 + 0^0 = 1 + 0 = 1
#this cycle is equal to 1, thats why it is a happy number 
#this cycle should keep going until we find 1 
#when we continuosly square sum of the digits and it equals to 1, its a happy number 
```
> Approach 
```bash
# JS

#set only stores unique values 
Check if the num does not exist in set 
      - add num to set 
      - initalize sqrtSum 
      - iterate over each digit and add to sqrtSum 
      
      if sqrtSum == 1 
         return true 
      else 
         return false 
```
```bash
var isHappy = function(n){
  let map = new Set()

#while the number does not exist in the hash map 
  while(!map.has(n)){
    map.add(n)
    sqSum = 0 

    #while number > 0 
    while(n>0){
      #sum of squares 
      sqSum = sqSum + (n%10)*(n%10)
      n = Math.floor(n/10)
    }

     #if sqSum is 1 its a happy number 
    if(sqSum == 1){
      return true
    }
    #n is set to the calculated square sum 
    n = sqSum 
  }
  return false 
}

n>0      |   sqSum = sqSum + (n%10)*(n%10)         |   n = Math.floor(n/10)   | n = sqSum 
123>0    |  sqSum = 0 + (123%10)(123%10) = 0+9=9   |   n = 123/10 = 12       
         |  sqSum = 9 + (12%10)*(12%10) = 9+4=13   |   n = 12/10 = 1 
         |  sqSum = 13 + (1%10)*(1%10) = 13+1=14   |   n = 1/10 = 0           | n = 14 

14>0     | sqSum = 0 + (14%10)*(14%10) = 0+16=16   |   n = 14/10 = 1
         | sqSum = 1 + (1%10)*(1%10) = 16+1 = 17   |   n = 1/10 = 0           | n = 17 

# similarly its going to work until it manages to find sqSum = 1, if it does it returns true, else it returns false
